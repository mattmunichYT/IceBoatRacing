## 🎪 Feature Showcase

### 🏁 Race Creation Wizard (`/race create`)

An interactive, title-guided wizard walks you through:

1. **Name the race** — unique identifier
2. **Set lap count** — how many laps to finish
3. **Define track?** — jump to AutoTrace or skip
4. **AutoTrace** — drive a full lap; plugin generates checkpoints
5. **Define cars?** — register participant boats
6. **Save** — race persisted to YAML

> All steps are optional — you can define track/cars later via `/checkpoint autotrace` and `/car create`. Pit boxes and required pit-stop count are configured separately after race creation, via `/pitbox create` and `/race setPitStops` (not currently part of the wizard).

### 📍 Checkpoint System

#### Two Geometry Modes

| Mode               | Shape                                                       | Use Case                          | Creation                                                                         |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **BOX** (legacy)   | Axis-aligned cuboid (min/max corners)                       | Simple straight tracks            | Wooden shovel left/right click two blocks → `/checkpoint create <race> [SECTOR]` |
| **PLANE** (modern) | Oriented rectangle (center + normal + halfWidth/halfHeight) | Curved, diagonal, elevated tracks | **AutoTrace** or manual via YAML                                                 |

> **PLANE checkpoints** use precise double-precision centers and ray-plane intersection for crossing detection — far more reliable on non-axis-aligned tracks.

#### Checkpoint Types

| Type           | Purpose                      | AutoTrace Output                                  |
|----------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `START_FINISH` | Lap counter + race start/end | First generated checkpoint (cardinal-snapped)     |
| `NORMAL`       | Standard lap progression     | All intermediate checkpoints                      |
| `SECTOR`       | Split timing (optional)      | Added manually via `/checkpoint autotrace sector` |

#### Alternate Routes (Bypass Gates)

Attach secondary physical gates to any checkpoint — crossing **either** counts. Perfect for:
- Pit/stands lanes that rejoin past the start/finish line
- Shortcut routes that merge back
- Spectator bypass corridors

```bash
# Select two corners with wooden shovel, then:
/checkpoint addAlternate <raceName> <checkpointID>
```

### 🤖 AutoTrace — Drive, Don't Place

```
/checkpoint autotrace start <raceName> [spacing] [halfWidth] [halfHeight] [loop|noloop]
```

1. **Start recording** — configurable point spacing (default 3 blocks)
2. **Drive one full lap** — boat or on foot
3. **Auto-stops** when you return near the start (configurable threshold)
4. **Preview** — particle outlines (Flame=Start/Finish, End Rod=Normal, Villager=Sector)
5. **Edit** — resize/delete individual checkpoints by clicking near them
6. **Add sectors** — mark split gates with shovel
7. **Accept** — batch-saves all as PLANE checkpoints in one YAML write

**Under the hood:**
- Ramer-Douglas-Peucker simplification (ε=0.4)
- Even arc-length resampling
- Track-surface recentering (scans for ice/packed ice/blue ice)
- Per-checkpoint width measurement
- Cardinal snapping for start/finish & sectors

### 🚤 Car/Boat Registration

```
/car create
```

1. **Break a block** — sets spawn location (block +1 Y)
2. **Enter owner name** — offline players supported
3. **Hold a boat item** — any wood type, raft, or chest variant
4. **Select race** — clickable list if not in RaceCreator flow

**Supported boat types:** Oak, Spruce, Birch, Jungle, Acacia, Dark Oak, Mangrove, Cherry, Bamboo, Pale Oak + all chest variants.

Cars spawn automatically on `/race prepare`, teleport owners inside, set invulnerable, apply custom name, and rotate to `race.startRotation` (configurable).

### 📊 Live Scoreboard

Global objective `live_ice_boat_racing` (sidebar) updates per-player each tick:
- Current lap / total laps
- Checkpoint progress within lap
- Auto-sorts by progress

### 🏁 Race Lights (Optional)

Configure a 3D region in `config.yml` (`race.lights.from` → `race.lights.to`). On `/race start`:
```
5 (Dark red) → 4 (Red) → 3 (Orange) → 2 (Yellow) → 1 (Lime) → GO! (Green)
```
Each stage fills the region with the corresponding stained-glass, synced with title countdown and pling sounds.

### 🅿️ Pit Boxes (Mandatory Pit Stops)

Each race can require racers to complete a configurable number of pit stops before finishing counts as valid — enforced end-to-end, from trigger detection through final standings.

**Setup (`/pitbox create <race>`):**

1. **Name the pit box** — for identification in `/pitbox list`
2. **Define location** — select 2 corners with the wooden shovel wand (reuses the same wand as `/checkpoint create`), then confirm
3. **Set duration** — seconds the stop takes
4. **Set allowed players** — specific names, or `*` for anyone racing
5. **Pick a color** — solid or gradient (see below)

**At race time:**

- Pit box detection is folded into the same `PlayerMoveEvent` loop used for checkpoint crossing — no separate listener re-walking every racing boat each tick.
- Entering an eligible, unoccupied box freezes the boat (velocity zeroed every tick) for the box's duration — no early exit is possible, since the freeze itself keeps the player inside the trigger volume.
- An adaptive title countdown (`5, 4, 3... Go!`) tracks the box's configured duration, with a rising-pitch pling on completion.
- Only one player may occupy a given box at a time; a box can be scoped to specific player names (e.g. a 2-driver team) or opened to everyone.
- Each race tracks a `requiredPitStops` count (`/race setPitStops <race> <amount>`, defaults to 1). Racers who cross the finish line short of that count are automatically **disqualified**, with an immediate broadcast notice and a `DSQ` marker at the bottom of the final standings — below all qualified finishers, in original crossing order.

**Colors:** a preset `PitBoxColor` enum (not free-form hex), including real F1 team livery gradients — McLaren, Mercedes, Red Bull, Ferrari, Williams, VCARB, Aston Martin, Haas, Alpine, Audi, Cadillac — plus solid basics and a few extra gradients (the plugin's own brand gradient, fire, rainbow). Colors render via MiniMessage and apply to both the "BOX BOX" call and the countdown title. Editable post-creation with `/pitbox setColor <race> <id> <color>`.

> Pit box task type is stored as an enum (`TIMED` for now) rather than hardcoded, so future task types can be added without a config migration.

### 🌍 Multi-Language (i18n)

Two built-in languages: `en_US` (default), `fr_FR`. Set in `config.yml`:
```yaml
language: fr_FR
```
Messages use **MiniMessage** (gradients, hex, formatting) + `%placeholder%` substitution. All user-facing text is externalized — add new languages by dropping a `<lang>.yml` in `plugins/IceBoatRacing/lang/`.

## 📦 Requirements

| Requirement   | Version                   |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| **Minecraft** | 1.21.4+                   |
| **Paper**     | 1.21.4-R0.1+ (API)        |
| **Java**      | 21 (toolchain enforced)   |

> The plugin uses Paper's Brigadier command API, Adventure text components, and modern NMS mappings — **Paper is required**; Spigot/CraftBukkit/Purpur/Folia untested. `1.21.4` is also the version Paper hard-forked from its former Spigot upstream, making it effectively the floor for the current Paper API — and the version `registerCommand()`, used throughout this plugin's command classes, was introduced in. Built and tested on Java 21 with no errors at this floor.

---

## 📥 Installation

1. **Download** the latest `.jar` from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/ibr) or [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/bukkit-plugins/ice-boat-racing), or build from source ([see below](#-building-from-source)).
2. Place `IceBoatRacing-<version>.jar` in your server's `plugins/` folder.
3. **Restart** the server (or `/ibr reload` if hot-reloading).
4. First run generates:
   - `plugins/IceBoatRacing/config.yml`
   - `plugins/IceBoatRacing/lang/en_US.yml`
   - `plugins/IceBoatRacing/lang/fr_FR.yml`
   - `plugins/IceBoatRacing/races/` (directory for race YAMLs)

## ⚙️ Configuration

### `config.yml`

```yaml
# Language file to load from lang/ (without .yml)
language: en_US

race:
  # Allow players to rejoin mid-race after logout
  allowRejoin: true

  # Gamemode during race (ADVENTURE recommended; SURVIVAL/CREATIVE possible)
  racingGameMode: ADVENTURE

  # Prevent checkpoint detection if player not in racingGameMode
  enforceRacingGameMode: true

  # Put finishers in spectator mode
  spectateOnFinish: true

  # Remove player's car on logout
  removeCarWhenLoggingOut: false

  # Race starting lights (stained-glass countdown)
  lights:
    enabled: false
    from:
      x: 123456789
      y: 123456789
      z: 123456789
    to:
      x: 123456789
      y: 123456789
      z: 123456789

  # Boat yaw on race start (degrees) — adjust if boats face wrong way
  startRotation: 0
```

**Notes:**
- `lights.from`/`to` default to `123456789` — if unchanged, lights are **disabled** regardless of `enabled: true`.
- `racingGameMode`: `SPECTATOR` will not work (players can't control boats).
- `startRotation`: Paper uses degrees (0 = South, 90 = West, 180 = North, 270 = East).
- **Pit stops are not configured in `config.yml`** — they're per-race (`requiredPitStops`, set via `/race setPitStops`) and per-box (location, duration, allowed players, color, set via `/pitbox create`/`setAllowed`/`setColor`), living in each race's own YAML like checkpoints and cars.

### `paper-plugin.yml` (embedded in JAR)

Defines plugin metadata, permissions tree, and load order (`POSTWORLD`). Not user-editable.

### Language Files (`lang/*.yml`)

All messages externalized with MiniMessage formatting. Key sections:
- `prefix` — global message prefix (gradient)
- `noPrefix` — scoreboard title, join/quit messages
- `checkpoint.*` — all checkpoint/AutoTrace messages
- `race.*` — race lifecycle, lap/sector/finish broadcasts, final standings, pit-stop count
- `pitbox.*` — pit box creation, list, countdown, disqualification-adjacent messages
- `car.*` — car creation, errors
- `error.*` — generic errors

Add a new language by copying `en_US.yml` → `<lang>.yml`, translating values, and setting `language: <lang>` in `config.yml`.

## 🛠 How It Works

### Data Flow

```
Race Creation (RaceCreator)
    │
    ├── Step 1-2: Name + Laps → Race object + YAML
    ├── Step 3-4: AutoTrace (CheckpointCommand + AutoTraceManager)
    │       ├── Record player positions (2-tick interval)
    │       ├── On loop close / stop → simplify → resample → recenter on ice
    │       ├── Build PLANE checkpoints (oriented rectangles)
    │       ├── Particle preview (toggleable)
    │       └── Accept → batch write to race YAML
    ├── Step 5-6: Car Creation (CarCreator + CarManager)
    │       ├── Break block → spawn location
    │       ├── Owner name → UUID
    │       ├── Held boat item → type + custom name
    │       └── Save to race YAML (cars.<id>.*)
    └── Done → Race ready

Pit Box Creation (PitBoxCreator) — separate flow, run any time after the race exists
    │
    ├── Step 1: Name
    ├── Step 2: Location (wooden shovel wand, reuses CheckpointCommand's pos1/pos2)
    ├── Step 3: Duration (seconds)
    ├── Step 4: Allowed players (names or "*")
    ├── Step 5: Color (preset PitBoxColor)
    └── Save → PitBoxManager.savePitBox() → race YAML (pitboxes.<id>.*)
```

### Race Execution (`RaceManager` + `RaceListener`)

1. **`/race prepare`** → `prepareRace()`
   - Sets `preparingRace = true`
   - For each car: `CarManager.spawnCar()` → spawns invulnerable boat, sets custom name, rotates, adds passenger
   - Creates `RaceData` per player, initializes lap/sector tracking
   - Adds to global `live_ice_boat_racing` scoreboard

2. **`/race start`** → `startRace()`
   - 6-tick countdown (5→4→3→2→1→GO!) with titles, sounds, optional lights
   - Sets `hasRaceStarted = true`

3. **`RaceListener.onMove()`** (every `PlayerMoveEvent` in a boat)
   - Validates: in vehicle, is boat, has race data, correct gamemode
   - **Segment-ray intersection** against `nextCheckpoint` (and `next+1` for skip tolerance)
   - `Checkpoint.crosses(from, to)` handles both BOX (slab intersection) and PLANE (ray-plane) + alternates
   - On `START_FINISH`:
      - Lap 0 → set `startTime`
      - Lap < total → `onCompleteLap()` (broadcast, title, best-lap check, scoreboard update)
      - Lap == total → `onFinishRace()` (ranking, gaps, stats, spectate/cleanup, disqualification check)
   - On `SECTOR` → record sector split, broadcast
   - **Pit box check** runs right after the checkpoint loop, reusing the same `RaceData` lookup — no second listener re-iterating racing boats:
      - Skip if `pitStopsCompleted >= requiredPitStops` (already done) or the player is mid-stop (`pittingBox != null`)
      - Otherwise, for each unoccupied `PitBox` the player is allowed to use and physically inside: start a session — occupy the box, freeze velocity every tick via a repeating task, run the adaptive countdown title, and on completion increment `pitStopsCompleted` and release the box

4. **`onFinishRace()`**
   - Computes `disqualified = pitStopsCompleted < race.getRequiredPitStops()` at the moment of finish-line crossing
   - Broadcasts a disqualification notice immediately if applicable
   - Ranking/gap/stats messages otherwise unchanged

5. **`/race end`** or **last finisher** → `endRace()`
   - Broadcasts `race.end`
   - Destroys cars, clears scoreboard, resets race state
   - Sends full standings (`Race.sendRanking()`), which walks finish order by crossing index, lists all qualified finishers first, then disqualified racers at the bottom under a `DSQ` marker

### Persistence

Each race = one YAML file: `plugins/IceBoatRacing/races/<name>.yml`

```yaml
name: "Monaco"
world: "world"
lapCount: 3
requiredPitStops: 2
checkpoints:
  1:
    shape: PLANE
    world: "world"
    center: "100.5,64.0,200.3"
    normal: "0.0,0.0,-1.0"
    halfWidth: 4.5
    halfHeight: 3.0
    type: START_FINISH
  2:
    shape: PLANE
    #...
pitboxes:
  1:
    name: "Team Red"
    world: "world"
    min: "95,64,180"
    max: "98,66,183"
    taskType: TIMED
    duration: 5
    allowed:
      - "*"
    color: FERRARI
cars:
  1:
    world: "world"
    startingLocation: "100,65,200"
    owner: "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
    boatMaterial: "OAK_BOAT"
    boatCustomName: "Car #1"
```

Loaded on startup via `RaceManager.loadAllRaces()` → `CheckpointManager.loadRaceCheckpoints()` + `CarManager.loadCars()` + `PitBoxManager.loadRacePitBoxes()`.
Or reloaded from file by using `/ibr reload`.

## 💡 Examples & Usage

### Quick Start: Create a Race in 2 Minutes

```bash
# 1. Create race (wizard)
/race create
# → Enter name: "Monaco"
# → Enter laps: "3"
# → "yes" to define track
# → Stand on start line, type anything in chat
# → Drive one full lap
# → /checkpoint autotrace stop
# → /checkpoint autotrace preview  (verify)
# → /checkpoint autotrace accept
# → "yes" to define cars
# → For each car: break spawn block → type owner name → hold boat → "save"
# → Type "save" when done

# 2. Prepare & start
/race prepare Monaco
/race start Monaco
```

### Add Sector Gates After AutoTrace

```bash
/checkpoint autotrace start Monaco
# (preview already exists from previous accept)
/checkpoint autotrace preview
# Walk to sector location, shovel-click two blocks for gate width
/checkpoint autotrace sector
# Repeat for each sector
/checkpoint autotrace accept
```

### Add Alternate Route (ex: Pit Lane)

```bash
# Shovel-select two corners of pit lane gate
/checkpoint addAlternate Monaco 1
```

### Add Mandatory Pit Stops

```bash
# Require 2 pit stops to finish
/race setPitStops Monaco 2

# Create a pit box (wizard)
/pitbox create Monaco
# → Enter name: "Team Red"
# → Shovel-select 2 corners of the pit box zone, type "confirmer"
# → Enter duration: "5"
# → Enter allowed players: "*"
# → Enter color: "FERRARI"

# Edit later without redoing the wizard
/pitbox setAllowed Monaco 1 Alex Steve
/pitbox setColor Monaco 1 MCLAREN
```

### Change Language to French

```yaml
# config.yml
language: fr_FR
```
Then `/ibr reload`.

### Customize Race Lights

```yaml
# config.yml
race:
  lights:
    enabled: true
    from:
      x: 100
      y: 64
      z: 200
    to:
      x: 105
      y: 66
      z: 205
```
Build a 3D frame at those coordinates — plugin will fill it with stained-glass on countdown.

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Why does the plugin require Paper (not Spigot/Purpur/Folia)?</strong></summary>
It uses Paper-specific APIs: Brigadier command registration (`io.papermc.paper.command.brigadier`), Adventure components (`net.kyori.adventure.*`), and modern NMS mappings. These are not available on Spigot forks.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use this on Folia (multithreaded Paper)?</strong></summary>
Not tested. The plugin uses main-thread-only Bukkit APIs (entity spawning, particle effects, scoreboard) and assumes single-threaded execution. Folia support would require significant refactoring.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>My boats face the wrong direction on start. How do I fix it?</strong></summary>
Set `race.startRotation` in `config.yml` (degrees: 0=South, 90=West, 180=North, 270=East). Reload with `/ibr reload`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>AutoTrace generated checkpoints in the wrong order / missed a turn.</strong></summary>
- Ensure you drive a **clean, continuous lap** without backtracking.
- Increase `spacing` (e.g., 5–8 blocks) for long straights; decrease for tight corners.
- Use `/checkpoint autotrace resize` / `delete` to fix individual gates before `accept`.
- For complex layouts, consider placing a few manual PLANE checkpoints via YAML.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Players can't cross checkpoints — "Illegal GameMode!" in action bar.</strong></summary>
Check `race.enforceRacingGameMode` and `race.racingGameMode` in `config.yml`. During prepare/start, players are set to `ADVENTURE` by default. If your server forces another gamemode, either disable enforcement or match the config.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What happens if a player skips a required pit stop?</strong></summary>
They're automatically disqualified the moment they cross the finish line with fewer completed stops than the race's <code>requiredPitStops</code> value, get an immediate broadcast notice, and appear separately at the bottom of the final standings under a <code>DSQ</code> marker. This is checked at finish-line crossing, not enforced by blocking the finish line itself — a player can still complete a lap without having pitted, they just won't be counted as a qualified finisher.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I lock a pit box to a specific team?</strong></summary>
Yes — <code>/pitbox setAllowed &lt;race&gt; &lt;id&gt; &lt;names...&gt;</code> restricts a box to specific player names (e.g. both drivers on a team), or use <code>*</code> for anyone racing. Only one player can occupy a given box at a time regardless of who's allowed.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I back up/migrate races?</strong></summary>
Copy the `plugins/IceBoatRacing/races/` folder (each `.yml` is a self-contained race, including its pit boxes). To migrate to another server, copy the folder and the `config.yml` + `lang/` files.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I have multiple races running simultaneously?</strong></summary>
Yes — `RaceManager.activeRaces` supports multiple concurrent races. Each has its own scoreboard entries (same objective, different scores). `/race start/prepare/end` accept a race name to target a specific one.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's the difference between BOX and PLANE checkpoints?</strong></summary>
**BOX** = axis-aligned cuboid (two corners). Simple but forces 90° angles. **PLANE** = oriented rectangle (center + normal + dimensions). Supports any angle, curved tracks, elevation changes. AutoTrace only produces PLANE. PLANE uses ray-plane intersection for precise crossing detection.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does the plugin support chest boats / bamboo rafts?</strong></summary>
Yes — all vanilla boat types including chest variants (`*_CHEST_BOAT`, `BAMBOO_CHEST_RAFT`) and `PALE_OAK_BOAT` (1.21.4+). Just hold the item during `/car create` step 3.
</details>

## 🧰 Developer API

IceBoatRacing does **not** currently expose a public Java API for other plugins. However, the following internal classes are stable enough for hooking (use at your own risk):

| Class               | Purpose                                                                                           |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `RaceManager`       | `getRace(String)`, `getRaces()`, `startRace(Race)`, `endRace(Race)`, `togglePrepareRace()`        |

| `AutoTraceManager`  | `start()`, `stop()`, `generatePreview()`, `accept()`, `togglePreview()`                           |
| `Race`              | `getCheckpoints()`, `getCars()`, `getPitBoxes()`, `getLapCount()`, `getRequiredPitStops()`, `racers` (Map<UUID, RaceData>) |
| `RaceData`          | `lapTimes`, `sectorsTimes`, `pitStopsCompleted`, `disqualified`, `bestLapTime()`, `meanLapTime()`, `getRaceTime()` |
| `Checkpoint`        | `crosses(Location, Location)`, `contains(Location)`, `getAlternates()`                            |
| `PitBox`            | `contains(Location)`, `isAllowed(String)`, `isOccupied()`, `getColor()`                           |
| `Messages`          | `getMessage(key, args...)`, `formatArguments(...)`                                                |

> **Stability:** No semantic versioning guarantee for internal classes. If you build an integration, consider forking or contacting the maintainer for a proper API module.

### Events You Can Listen To

All standard Bukkit events work. The plugin fires no custom events currently.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions welcome! Please:

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch** — `feature/amazing-thing` or `fix/issue-description`
3. **Follow the code style** — existing formatting, MiniMessage for messages, Brigadier for commands
4. **Test manually** — no automated test suite yet; spin up a Paper server
5. **Submit a PR** with a clear description

**Ideas from TODO.md:**
- Fix logout/rejoin mid-race
- Pit box task variety (currently `TIMED` only — e.g. skill-based stops)
- Enforce pit stops at the finish line itself rather than DSQ-ing after crossing
- Easier alternate route creation
- Convert legacy config.yml races to per-race YAML
- More tests
